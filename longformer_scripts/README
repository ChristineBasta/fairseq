Steps for the data:

1- run clean_directory.sh---- this step removes the files of other languages not desired.
It removes the lines that have AUTHOR, <P> and empty lines

2- run prepare_data.sh
remember to turn oin the numbering boolean if u want files to be numbered
change the extensions of the files according to what is available


this  file numbers the files
it gets the statistics, how many lines
it forms the all_file which contains all th files text if they are less than a certain number of lines
it forms sent_doc_dic for training

for test and dev... it gets the text of each file
It forms the doc_text dictionary which has the text for all the documents of the files.
It also makes sent_doc_dic for test and dev data.
it makes the all_set_doc_text_alignment which is important for the training

3- run preprocess_tok_tc_doc.sh
names should be named from teh above steps test and valid to save the renaming process
remember to move the all files to data folder to preprocess and revise names

This  step is for tokenizing and truecasing and adding <DOC> at the beginning of sentences

4- run reprocess.sh
make sure that the lftransfomer_model folder does not have previous copies
this is for bpe and fairseq-preprocess the data

we need to run fairseq-preprocess on those without <doc> for the baseline


5-Finally
run longformer_representations_script three times for the four reps with
different kind_reps to get the longformer representations of the train, test and dev

6- run longformer_dics.sh to make the dictionary of the three sets together in one file to be ready for training
