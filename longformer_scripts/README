Steps for the data:

1- run clean_directory.sh---- this step removes the files of other languages not desired.
It removes the lines that have AUTHOR, <P> and empty lines

2- run prepare_data.sh

change the extensions of the files according to whatis available


this  file numbers the files
it gets the statistics, how many lines
it forms the all_file which contains all th files text if they are less than a certain number of lines
it forms sent_doc_dic for training
for test and dev... it gets the text of ech file
It forms the doc_text dictionary which has the text for all the documents of the files.
It also makes sent_doc_dic for test and dev data.

3- run preprocess_tok_tc_doc.sh
